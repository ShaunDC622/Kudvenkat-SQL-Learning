# Kudvenkat-SQL-Learning
Queries created based on the SQL learning channel made by Venkat on his channel: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL08903FB7ACA1C2FB .
The queries created are based off of the videos, broken up into parts, and I treat them like notes I took while watching and learning the sections covered in the videos.
I will be going back to earlier queries to update them so that they contain the lines necessary to create and alter tables, stored procedures, and functions.

I ask that if you decide to make use of these queries, please make a copy for yourself or copy the text in the files - please do not change what is in the queries I wrote.
